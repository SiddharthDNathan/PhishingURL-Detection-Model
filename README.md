# PhishingURL-Detection-Model

Phishing URL Classification

This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at classifying phishing URLs. Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to individuals, organizations, and economies, making it crucial to develop robust models for accurate detection. The goal of this project is to develop a model capable of analyzing URL characteristics and determining whether they are legitimate or malicious.

Key Features:

    Utilizes a dataset from source(link in colab notebook).
    Implements supervised learning classification techniques
    Includes feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model training steps
    Evaluates model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
    Demonstrates the use of logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision tree models
    Explores overfitting and multicollinearity detection techniques
    Provides insights into model evaluation with and without cross-validation
    Offers an end-to-end data science project with detailed documentation and code explanations

Note:
This project aims to keep the implementation simple and elegant for better understanding and easy follow-through. The exceptionally high model accuracy and performance have been validated through cross-validation techniques, ensuring robustness and reliability in phishing URL classification.
